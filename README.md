# HKUST_Schedule_Crawler_Python
HKUST (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology) is one of the most popular technical and business institute in Asia and entire world. As a result, all the classes are almost filled and it's not uncommon that students have to spend a lot of time tracking the waitlist quota and schedules on the website. Even I faced the similar problems while deciding on my classes. As a result, I decided to make a web crawler using Python that requires TERM and CLASS as an input and provides all details that a website would provide. Also, I kind of ERROR HANDLING is done in the first version of code itself. Extensive unit testing will be done once the project will be complete. I have already completed more than half of the process in less than 2 hours. I will finish the first version really soon and the next step will be to get in touch with USThing developers and integrate this functionality with their existing app. Thanks! I love doing such fun projects.
